You wake up and find yourself lying on a beautiful caribbean beach.

There is a boat tied to palm tree.

Behind you there is a thick jungle

You can decide if you want to …

* Take the boat and paddle around the island?
* Enter the jungle and see what you find there?

Do you dare to enter the cave?

      next: cave

## The Cave

You enter the cave and go deeper and deeper inside.

It is very dark now but in the distance you see glimpse of light. As you get closer, you can see that there is an exit.

Outside you can see the spires of a building, probably an old castle.

Also to your left there is an entrance to a very dark tunnel.

Do you want to…

* Leave the cave?
* Enter the dark tunnel?

- continue:
    - prompt: Leave the cave
      next: castle
    - prompt: Enter the tunnel
      next: tunnel

## The Tunnel

Go further, deeper and deeper inside. Everything is black and suddenly you hear a loud flattering noise coming from all over the place.

Bats!

You better get out of here, fast.

## The Boat

You untie the boat and start paddling around the island.

On the other side of the island there is a mysterious castle.

Just when you decided to go ashore you see something shining from under water.

Do you want to…

* Go in the water to dive for the flashy thing?
* Go ashore and check out the castle?

    - prompt: Dive for shining thing
      next: dive
    - prompt: Go ashore to castle

## The Dive

You go in the water, take a deep breath, and dive.

You grab the shining thing. It is a beautiful ring. You decide to keep it. But is this the treasure?

-id: castle

## The Castle

You are standing in front of a magical castle with a large wooden door.

On the side of the castle runs a little creek.

Do you dare to knock?

Or do you rather want to go down to the creek and see what is there?

- continue:
    - prompt: Knock on wooden door
      next: knock
    - prompt: Go towards the creek
      next: creek

- id: creek

## The Creek

You get to the creek. The water is very fresh and clear and you decide to take a drink.

That feels good!

The edges of the creek are vegetated so heavily that there is no further passing possible.

You have to go back.

## The Wizard

The door opens slowly.

In the back of a shadowy room there is an old man in a long robe with a large hat.

He says:

> <i>"I cover cities and destroy mountains, I make men blind, yet help them see. Who am I?"</i>

Do you know the answer? Then choose wisely:

- continue:
    - prompt: The answer starts with S…
      next: s
    - prompt: The answer starts with P…
      next: p
    - prompt: The answer starts with A…
